# User Rules for the LLM: Music Creation Edition

These rules guide the language model toward generating **musically expressive, emotionally resonant compositions**—especially when interfacing with tools like Ableton Live's MCP server.

---

## 1. Choose a Key Signature First and Stay in It
- Begin by selecting a **musically expressive key** (e.g., D minor, A major, G Dorian).
- All harmonic and melodic content must follow the selected key and scale.
- Only use accidentals when intentionally creating tension or modal variation.

---

## 2. Build the Harmonic Foundation First
- Design a **chord progression** rooted in functional harmony (e.g., tonic–dominant relationships).
- Use progressions that resolve emotionally (e.g., I–V–vi–IV or i–iv–V–i).
- Chords should drive the emotion and structure of the piece.

---

## 3. Melody Must Fit the Harmony
- Compose melodies using tones from the selected scale.
- Strong beats should land on chord tones; passing/neighbor tones should enhance movement.
- Shape melodies with **musical phrasing** and **contour** (e.g., arches, waves).

---

## 4. Rhythm Is as Important as Pitch
- Avoid evenly spaced notes—**use rhythmic motifs** and phrasing.
- Include rests, syncopation, and tension-release patterns.
- Percussion should **reinforce the pulse** and support the melodic phrasing.

---

## 5. Use Logical Instrumentation and Layering
- Assign instruments according to their **sonic role**:
  - Low-end: bass, kick
  - Mid-range: chords, rhythm instruments
  - High-end: leads, pads, strings
- Avoid frequency clutter; each part must have space to breathe.

---

## 6. Structure Matters: Compose in Sections
- Define a structure before writing notes: e.g., Intro → Build → Chorus → Outro.
- Each section should offer **contrast** and contribute to a **narrative arc**.
- Reuse and vary motifs to create **cohesion** across the piece.

---

## 7. Build Emotion Through Dynamic Layers
- Use volume, rhythm, texture, and harmony to build or resolve tension.
- Introduce elements gradually—don’t start fully layered.
- Contrast soft vs loud, sparse vs dense, smooth vs sharp.

---

## 8. Think Like a Composer, Not a Sequencer
- Every note should have a **musical purpose**.
- Avoid random MIDI patterns—compose **phrases**, not fragments.
- Use **rest and silence** as powerful compositional tools.

---

## 9. Stay Realistic with Note Ranges and Timing
- Keep notes within realistic pitch/velocity ranges for each instrument.
- Avoid overly quantized patterns—introduce **natural timing and human feel**.
- For strings/pads/piano: favor sustained phrases and voice leading over disjointed notes.

---

## 10. Output Must Be Structured and Usable
- Include: track names, instruments, section markers, clip lengths.
- Use **MCP-compatible commands** (`create_midi_track`, `create_clip`, `add_notes_to_clip`, etc.).
- Group all data logically by track and section for clarity.

---

## Bonus Creative Guidelines

- Introduce **counterpoint** when fitting (independent melodic voices).
- Use **modal interchange** or chromatic passing tones for color.
- Focus on **voice leading**: ensure smooth note movement between chords.
